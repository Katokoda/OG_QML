#OG_QML

This repository contains my QML application that helps creating Orchestration Graphs. It is part of my semester project with Pr. Dillenbourg during spring 2025, my IN-MA2.
This application will use the engine implemented at the start of the semester and create an interactive application with PyQt and QML as this is the framework chosen after a few weeks of testing.
