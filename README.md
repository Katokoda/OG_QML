# An Engine producing Orchestration Graphs.

This repository contains my QML application that helps creating Orchestration Graphs. It is part of my semester project done  at EPFL with Pr. Dillenbourg during spring 2025, my IN-MA2.

This application uses the engine implemented with Python at the start of the semester. It is interactive application built with PyQt and QML as this was the framework chosen after a few weeks of testing.

## Installation

I developped the Python Engine mostly from Windows but then switched to Linux for the interactive application.

If you want to run the application, I recommend using a linux machine which can already run Python code and create a new virtual environnement. Within this environnement, you can install all required packages using

\>>> pip install -r requirements.txt

This installs all packages listed in the requirements.txt file. Note: This file was generated using pipreqs //TODO redo after project completion

Then, you can run the application using

\>>> python3 main.py

// TODO include a screenshot of the first viewed image.
