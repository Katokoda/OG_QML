This holds the parameters used in the program. You can (and should) adujst PLANE_NAMES according to your data.
You can also adjust PRECISION and TRESHOLD to your needs. Note that they mostly affect the detailed technical view (of the state of the class)

# Insert the name as they will be present in the DATA
# And in top-down order according to GUI
PLANE_NAMES = ["Indiv.", "Team", "Class"]

PRECISION = 0.01 # to avoid saying "not reached" when 0.00001 from goal.
TRESHOLD = 0.05 # To allow a "gap" between two pValues before saying a goal is not reached.
# NOTE: this should depend of the dimensionality.
# Another way to do would be to restrict bigger difference.
