This folder is a temporary folder that will be populated during the execution of the application (in particular the External printing of an Orchestration graph).
Do not delete the folder but feel free to delete its content when the application is not running.
Do not add or modify files except if you know what you are doing (those files may be unpickled which can cause undefined behavior).
